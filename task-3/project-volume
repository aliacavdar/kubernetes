what is Projected Volume?

The projected volume is a volume that projects several existing volume sources 
into the same directory. Currently, one can project configmaps, downward API,
 and secrets. The resulting pod spec is also shorter when projecting to a single 
 volume as opposed to multiple different locations. See all-in-one volume design 
 document for more information.
